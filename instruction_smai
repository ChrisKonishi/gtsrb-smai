Students whose projects were attached to me, we'll not be having a traditional face to face evaluation, instead please send the github/bitbucket link for your project with a comprehensive README. It'll be better if the teams could share the version controlled repository so that I can take the commit progress into account.

What should the README contain?

1. A brief outline of the structure of the code.

2. Instructions for setting up and running the code. (Adding a nice demo file is recommended.)

3. Any specifics that may be important to discuss regarding the codebase.

4. Also, specific list of files that your team has written on your own or substantially modified, along with the list of repositories from where you have taken code from. 

5. If there are any hyperparameters that you had to tune and preliminary or otherwise results to display, please add them in RESULTS.txt. A discussion of the same will be a bonus, but not necessary.

6. It's also recommended that you add all the table/graph making code (that you might have used for slides) to the codebase in a subfolder, say "report".

Please do the above by 1st latest.
