### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary

  Traffic signs are characterized by a wide variability in their visual appearance in real-world environments. For example, changes
of illumination, varying weather conditions and partial occlusions impact the perception of road signs. In practice, a large number
of different sign classes needs to be recognized with very high accuracy. Traffic signs have been designed to be easily readable
for humans, who perform very well at this task. For computer systems, however, classifying traffic signs still seems to pose a
challenging pattern recognition problem.
